# Possible Improvements

* Expand language support​
  * Literals ​
  * Assign ​
 
* ~Connections Type​~
* GeneralNet Type​
* Saving of block level connections + simulation results
* Block diagram UI​
* Drag and drop blocks​
* Form connections by clicking ​
* Show connections being formed (likely use a library)​
* Simulation UI
* Show waveforms​
* Scripting language?​
