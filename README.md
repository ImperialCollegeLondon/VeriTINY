# HLP2020-Verilog2

The project deliverable is an easy to use tool for designing and simulating simple synchronous single-clock hardware. The deliverable will execute circuits that are designed using a subset of Verilog (VeriTINY) at gate level and configurable megablocks for components such as registers, RAMs, adders/subtractors and multiplexers.

Extensions for this deliverable include a GUI, high quality hints/error messages in the program and display of waveforms during simulation.
